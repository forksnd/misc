Getting started

<p>The window above is a MISC prompt. Type a line of MISC code and hit <b>Alt-Enter</b> to run it.</p>
<p>MISC uses a prefix notation, that is the operator comes before the operands ("1 + 2" is written as "+ 1 2"). In MISC these are wrapped in square brackets, for example the sum 137+349 is written as <a class="example">[+ 137 349]</a>.</p>
<p>Try some simple expressions:
<ul>
<li><a class="example">[- 150 75]</a>
<li><a class="example">[+ 2.7 10]</a>
<li><a class="example">[+ [* 3 5] [- 10 6]]</a>
<li><a class="example">[+ [* 3 [+ [* 2 4] [+ 3 5]]] [+ [- 10 7] 6]]</a>
<li><a class="example">[help]</a>
</ul>
</p>
<p>For the moment MISC can look much like LISP but with square brackets. All of the above examples would be valid LISP if written with normal brackets "()".</p>
