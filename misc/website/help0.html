MISC

<p><i>MISC is a homoiconic, non-strict, metadata rich, language that uses maps as its base data structure.</i></p>
<p>MISC attempts to combine the simplicity of the syntax and design of LISP, the lazy semantics of a language like <i>Haskell</i>, the fundamental data type of <i>Lua</i> and <i>Javascript</i> and a syntax similar to that of <i>Smalltalk</i>. MISC could be thought of as a lazily evaluated LISP where the fundamental data type of the language is a mapping. </p>
<hr>
<p>The design and concept of MISC originated from three distinct ideas. Firstly to create an alternative data language to XML that provided a similar but consistent structure. Secondly to create a LISP like language using associative arrays or maps instead of lists. And thirdly to support rich metadata within the programming language, and to provide consistent access to it through 
reflection.</p>

<p>The main interesting aspects of the design are:
<ul>
<li>Lazy homoiconicity
<li>Deep integration of metadata
<li>Focusing on maps rather than lists
</ul>
